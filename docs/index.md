# EMOD model documentation

EMOD (Epidemiological MODeling software) is a stochastic, agent-based modeling
framework that simulates the simultaneous interactions of agents in an effort
to recreate the complex phenomena of disease transmission. Built in C++, the
models are feature-rich and designed to track the movement, development,
health, and other traits of interest for individuals over a course of lifetimes.

## Project status

EMOD-Hub projects are provided as open source software under the MIT License for
community use, research, and development.

**Unless otherwise noted, these projects are no longer actively maintained or supported
by IDM or the Gates Foundation.**

Community contributions are welcome, and trusted collaborators may review and
merge pull requests, but no guarantees are made regarding support, pull request
review, security response, maintenance, or release timelines.

## Available models and utilities

EMOD is the disease model framework, offering disease-specific models for malaria and HIV alongside Python packages for configuring and running simulations. The idmtools package is a model-agnostic framework that handles the surrounding infrastructure: job commissioning, HPC integration, calibration, and more. While each can be used independently, we recommend using them together for a seamless, integrated workflow.

### EMOD

The EMOD framework is powerful and flexible, and can be customized to examine a variety of epidemiological problems. Source code is available for those interested in modifying code to create custom models, and various transmission modes are available to investigate specific disease-oriented questions.

### idmtools

The idmtools package is a collection of Python scripts and utilities that streamlines the full modeling workflow: input file creation, model calibration, commissioning simulations (both locally and on an HPC), and analyzing results. While idmtools is model-agnostic and compatible with custom R or Python models, it is purpose-built to work seamlessly with EMOD.
